# Discord-Poem-Bot
This bot allows you to write a poem to a database, join a voice channel and read out the poem to you, output the poem on the text channel etc. 

You need to download ffmpeg off the internet and also the imported libraries (including PyNACL) by using pip. Then replace the bot token at the end and also the path to ffmpeg.exe. Then add the bot to your server and simply run the file.
